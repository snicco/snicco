**BetterWPAPI** is a single class that contains proxy methods for some of the most use **WordPress** core methods.

It's meant to be used in **distributed** **WordPress libraries** and helps you to keep your library testable and
[scopable](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper).

## Motivation

We developed this library for the **WordPress** related components of the
[**Snicco**](https://github.com/sniccowp/sniccowp) project.

Directly interacting with core functions was problematic for us because:

- Code becomes untestable without
    - a) booting the entire **WordPress** codebase or
    - b) using additional mocking frameworks ([mocking sucks](https://twitter.com/icooper/status/1036527957798412288)).
- The code becomes[ really hard to scope](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/303) using the de-facto standard
  tool [PHPScoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper).
- Static analysers like **Psalm** and **PHPStan** go crazy over core functions.

If you can't relate to these issues, you probably don't need this library.

**Edit:** The scoping problem was solved, by us creating
a [command-line-programm](https://github.com/sniccowp/php-scoper-excludes) that can be used to generate
a [list of all functions and classes](https://github.com/sniccowp/php-scoper-wordpress-excludes/blob/master/generated/exclude-wordpress-functions.json)
in the entire **WordPress** core codebase. For now, the best example on how to use it
is [the `scoper.inc.php` configuration](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/blob/main/scoper.inc.php#L13)
of the [Google Web stories plugin](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp).

## Installation

```shell
composer require sniccowp/better-wp-api
```

## Usage

[This is the public API](https://github.com/sniccowp/better-wp-api/blob/master/src/BetterWPAPI.php#L36) of
**BetterWPAPI**. No public or protected methods will be added until a next major version.

The idea is to limit the interaction with **WordPress** core to this class.

This has worked very well for us in order to keep our code testable and scopable. You have a single class where you can
see all interaction that your library has with **core**. During tests, you can then simply swap this class with a test
double.

The important thing is that: **All classes that need anything from WordPress must accept this class as a constructor
dependency.**

A simple example: (for a real example, check out the 
[**BetterWPMail**](https://github.com/sniccowp/sniccowp/blob/licensing-and-docs/src/Snicco/Component/better-wp-mail/src/WPMailAPI.php)
component)

Assuming we have the following class:

```php
use Snicco\Component\BetterWPAPI\BetterWPAPI;

class CSVImporter {

    public function __construct(BetterWPAPI $wp = null) {
        $this->wp = $wp ?: new BetterWPAPI();
    }
    
    public function import(string $file){
    
        if(!$this->wp->currentUserCan('import-csv')) {
            throw new Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // import csv.
    }
    
}
```

This is how we use it in production code.

```php
$importer = new CSVImporter();

$importer->import(__DIR__.'/orders.csv');
```

This is how we test the code. No bootstrapping **WordPress** needed.

```php 
class CSVImporterTest extends TestCase {

   /**
    * @test
    */
    public function that_missing_permissions_throw_an_exception() {
        
        $this->expectExceptionMessage('Not authorized');
        
        $wp = new class extends BetterWPAPI {
            public function currentUserCan():bool {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        $importer = new CSVImporter($wp);
        $importer->import(__DIR__.'/test-users.csv');
    }

}

```
