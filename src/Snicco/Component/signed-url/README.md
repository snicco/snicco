## Motivation

While developing the [**Snicco** project](https://github.com/sniccowp/sniccowp) we couldn't find any good
**standalone PHP-libraries** for signing urls. We needed this functionality in a couple of places, so we decided to roll
our own implementation.

Features:

- Uses strong, random secrets, generated by
  a [CSPRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically-secure_pseudorandom_number_generator) and secure hash
  functions.
- Validates the signature, the expiration and an enforced usage-limit on a per url basis.
- PSR-7/15 compatible. No hidden dependencies on PHP super globals.
- Protects against [timing based side-channel attacks](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html)
- Permanently invalidates a signed-url after the max usage. (Rotating your secret invalidates all signed-urls)
- Defensively programmed, making incorrect usage very hard.
- Support for multiple storage backends.
- A properly tested and straightforward API.

While the term `signed-url` is technically incorrect (this package uses HMACs, not asymmetric signatures), 
we chose to stick to the way [Symfony](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-5-1-improved-urisigner) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/urls#signed-urls) name it.


## Installation

```sh
composer require snicco/signed-url
```

## Usage

### Creating a secret

Run the following command from your project root and store the generated secret in a secure location that is outside
your web root.

```shell
vendor/bin/generate-signed-url-secret
```
This will output a random, hex-encoded secret that looks like this:
`32|1e21be67f2279e485c7c5e8291d05edda7e76ffb01ddb8eb290ce826528ad2ff`

**This secret should NEVER be stored in version control.**

In your application, load the secret from an environment variable in your application using something like [`symfony/dotenv`](https://github.com/symfony/dotenv).

```php
// require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$secret = \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Secret::fromHexEncoded(getenv('SIGNED_URL_SECRET'));
```

---

### Creating a signed-url

```php
$secret = /* */

$hmac = new Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\HMAC($secret, 'sha256')

// This is a simple interface.
// Use one of the inbuilt storages in the #storages section or provide your own.
$storage = /* */

$signer = new \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\UrlSigner($storage, $hmac);

// The maximum lifetime in seconds that this link should be valid for.
$lifetime_in_sec = 60;

// The maximum amount that this link should be valid for.
// After each successfully validation this amount will be decreased by 1.
$usage_limit = 1;

// optional: adding request context that must be the same in order to
// successfully validate a signed-url.
$context = ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ?? '') . ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ?? '');

$signed_url = $signer->sign('https://example.com/unsubscribe?user_id=12' , $lifetime_in_sec, $usage_limit, $context);

$mailer = /* */

$href = $signed_url->asString();

// $href will be something like transformers:
// https://example.com/unsubscribe?user_id=12expires=1639783661&signature=Del1cGmLB1wVET6PJieCrQ==|1MTBBGIpEGPVuGaKDjjrHDBusMNoWB15Ng5lKBSSLQY=

$mailer->send('user12@gmail.com', "Click <a href='{{$href}}'> here <a/> to unsubscribe.")
```

### Validating a signed-url

Validation of signed-urls should be performed in a middleware to avoid boilerplate.

The code samples below describe the **manual** way to validate urls in any **PHP** application.

#### PSR-15 middleware

If your favorite framework is PSR-7/PSR-15 compatible and supports middleware on a per-route basis, you can use our
[PSR-15 middleware bridge](https://github.com/sniccowp/signed-url-psr15-bridge)
which makes this dead simple.

#### All PHP apps

```php

$storage = /* */
$hmac = /* */

// Clean expired links periodically.
try {
    // 0-100
    $percentage = 2;
   \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\GarbageCollector::clean($storage, $percentage);
   
} catch (UnavailableStorage $e) {
    // gc did not work for some reason. Log and continue.
    error_log($e->getMessage());
    
}

$validator = new \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\SignedUrlValidator($storage, $hmac);

$target = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'].'?'.$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];

try {

    // optional context, has to be the same scheme used at creation.
    $context = ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ?? '') . ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ?? '');
    
    $validator->validate( $target, $context);
    
} catch (\Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Exception\InvalidSignature $e ) {
        
   error_log("invalid signature.");     
   echo "This link has expired. Please request a new one."
    
} catch (\Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Exception\SignedUrlExpired $e ) {

   error_log("signed url expired.");    
   echo "This link has expired. Please request a new one."
   
} catch (\Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Exception\SignedUrlUsageExceeded $e ) {

   error_log("signed url usage exceeded.");  
   echo "This link has expired. Please request a new one."
}

// Everything is valid.
// If the link can be used multiple times the usage is decremented automatically by 1.
echo "You have been unsubscribed."
```

### Storage types

The [`Snicco\SignedUrl\Contracts\SingedUrlStorage`](src/Storage/SignedUrlStorage.php) keeps an identifier
for each signed-url that is created and ensures that your max usage limits are enforced.

Without some form of backend storage, signed-urls are valid any number of times until the expiration
timestamp is passed. (If this is what you want you can use the [`NullStorage`](src/Storage/NullStorage.php)).

---

#### SessionStorage (included):

The [`SessionStorage`](src/Storage/SessionStorage.php) accepts an `array` or any object that implements
`ArrayAccess` (**passed by reference**).

```php
// using an array.
$storage = new \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Storage\SessionStorage($_SESSION);

// using an object implementing ArrayAccess
$arr = new MyArrayAccess();
$storage = new \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Storage\SessionStorage($arr);
```

---

#### NullStorage (included)

The [`NullStorage`](src/Storage/NullStorage.php) does nothing. No signed-urls will be stored
and no usage limits are enforced. Use this only if your signed-urls should be valid any number of times before expiring.

Validity of a signed-url will be based solely on the correct signature and expriation timestamp.

---

#### InMemory (included):

You can use the  [`InMemoryStorage`](src/Storage/InMemoryStorage.php) during unit tests.

```php
$storage = new \Snicco\Component\SignedUrl\Storage\InMemoryStorage()
```

---

#### PSR16-Cache (bridge package):

We have a dedicated 
[PSR-16 bridge](https://github.com/sniccowp/signed-url-psr16-bridge)
that will allow you to use any **PSR-16 cache** as a storage.

---

#### Implementing your own storage:

Implementing your own storage is very easy. 
You only have to implement the simple [`SingedUrlStorage`](src/Storage/SignedUrlStorage.php) interface.

Use the [`snicco/signed-url-testing` package](https://github.com/sniccowp/signed-url-testing)
to test your implementation against the contract of the interface.
