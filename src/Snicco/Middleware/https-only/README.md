A middleware for the [`snicco/http-routing`](https://github.com/snicco/http-routing) component that will redirect all `http` requests to `https`.

## Installation

```shell
composer require snicco/https-only-middleware
```

## Usage

This middleware should be added for **globally** in the `MiddlewareResolver`.

There are no configuration options besides a `boolean` flag in the constructor to indicate a local environment (to suppress the redirect).
