## Installation

```shell
composer require snicco/share-cookies-middleware
```

## Usage

This middleware should be added (in a group) to all routes where cookies should be sent to the client.

This middleware will transform all `Cookies` that were added to the response object to an appropriate HTTP-header.

There are no configuration options.

````php
use Snicco\Middleware\ShareCookies\ShareCookies;

$configurator->get('route1', '/route1', SomeController::class)
             ->middleware(ShareCookies::class);
````
