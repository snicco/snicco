This middleware for the [`snicco/http-routing`](https://github.com/snicco/http-routing) component allows you
to discourage search-engines from indexing the current request path by using the `X-Robots-Tag` header.

## Installation

```shell
composer require snicco/no-robots-middleware
```

## Usage

This middleware can be added globally, in a group or on a per-route basis. Choose what works
best for you.

```php
use Snicco\Middleware\NoRobots\NoRobots;

// Disallows robots entirely (noindex,no archive,nofollow)
$configurator->get('route1', '/route1', SomeController::class)
              ->middleware(NoRobots::class);

// noindex, no archive, nofollow header is not added because its set to false.
$configurator->get('route1', '/route1', SomeController::class)
              ->middleware(NoRobots::class. ':true,false,true');

```
