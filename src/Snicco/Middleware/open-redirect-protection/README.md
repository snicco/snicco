This middleware protects your application against [open redirects](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).

It inspects the `location` header of the response and disallows any redirects to non-whitelisted
external hosts.

Instead, the user will be redirected to the configured "exit" page.
The intended redirect location will be available in a `intented_redirect` query variable.

## Installation

```shell
composer require snicco/open-redirect-protection-middleware
```

## Usage

This middleware should be added globally in the `MiddlewareResolver`.

The [`OpenRedirectProtection`](src/OpenRedirectProtection.php) middleware must be bound in the **PSR-11** container
that is used by the [`snicco/http-routing`](https://github.com/snicco/http-routing) component.

````php
use Snicco\Middleware\OpenRedirectProtection\OpenRedirectProtection;

// In your PSR-11 container.
$open_redirect_protection = new OpenRedirectProtection(
    'snicco.io', // the host of your application
    '/exit', // the page path
    [
        'stripe.com',
        'accounts.stripe.com'    
    ] // Whitelisted domains.
)
